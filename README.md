#### Wow Auction API
I'm really just doing this because it keeps me writing golang outside of work.
I don't really have plans for this to be published.

##### High level TODOs:
- Databae layer
- Caching layer
- Non-filthy logger
- Metrics instrumentation
- Godoc
- Flesh out a public API, if any
- Address the TODOs littered in the code
- Some kind of javascript/html to make use of this data 
- Figure out an economical way to store large amounts of useless data
